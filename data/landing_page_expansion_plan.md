# Landing Page Expansion Plan

## Current State
- **155 landing pages** built with personalized checkout
- **277 keywords** in strategy outline still need landing pages
- **~1.16M monthly volume** uncaptured

## Strategy: Keyword Clustering

Not every keyword needs its own landing page. We should cluster related keywords to single landing pages.
