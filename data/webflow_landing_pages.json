      "faq-1-answer": "<p>BUN (blood urea nitrogen) measures nitrogen in blood from protein breakdown. High BUN can indicate kidney problems, dehydration, or high protein intake.</p>",
      "faq-2-question": "What causes high BUN?",
      "faq-2-answer": "<p>High BUN can result from kidney disease, dehydration, high protein diet, heart failure, or gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>",
      "faq-3-question": "What's the BUN/creatinine ratio?",
      "faq-3-answer": "<p>This ratio helps distinguish kidney disease from other causes of elevated BUN. A high ratio may indicate dehydration or GI bleeding.</p>",
      "faq-4-question": "Is BUN the same as creatinine?",
      "faq-4-answer": "<p>No, but both assess kidney function. BUN is affected by diet and hydration. Creatinine is more specific to kidney function.</p>",
